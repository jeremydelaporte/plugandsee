Range of interval of time for energy counter snapshot: 5 min. - 60 min.

Note: In theory it can be between 244 µS to 255 hours but for now we
will restrict to the above range.

* Initialization of Control_1, Control_2 and Control_3 registers the first time
the mobile application connects to the device.

Control_1 register = 0x80
   CAP_SEL = 1 //12.5 pf load capacitance choosen
   T must be 0 as specified in the datasheet
   STOP = 0 // Should be read-only bit
   SR = 0 // We don't care for now
   12_24 = 0
   SIE = 0
   AIE = 0
   CIE = 0

Control_2 register = 0x02

Control_3 register
   PM[2:0] = 000 // TBC
   // Nothing more for now


Tmr_A_freq_ctrl = 0x03 // 1/60 Hz
Tmr_A_reg = 5 // 5 min. is the default value
Tmr_CLKOUT_ctrl = 0x02 // See table 34 page 32 for information

Once registers above are configured, every Tmr_A_reg minutes,
the µC will receive an interruption. Upon this interruption,
a task will read the current date/time and the value of the
global energy counter-previous value of the global energy counter
and save it to the EEPROM memory.

That's it
